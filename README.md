what is Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression is used to solve the classification problems, so itâ€™s called as Classification Algorithm that models the 
probability of output class. It is a classification problem where your target element is categorical Unlike in Linear Regression,
in Logistic regression the output required is represented in discrete values like binary 0 and 1. It estimates relationship 
between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variable (predictors) where dependent variable is categorical/nominal.
